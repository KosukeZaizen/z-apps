## Why reading Japanese Romaji story is good to study Japanese?

Studying English is much simpler than studying Japanese.
One Reason is that Japanese has three types of characters
 even though English has only alphabets.
Especially, Kanji is so hard to remember
 because there are so many Kanji characters in Japanese.

If you are a beginner of studying Japanese, Kanji will annoy you so much.
When you try to read a Japanese book, it would include a lot of Kanji.
You can not read a natural Japanese document without knowing Kanji.

For many Japanese learners,
 remembering Hiragana is a first step to study Japanese.
But if you are completely new to Japanese,
 perhaps you can not read Hiragana.

In that case,
 reading Japanese Romaji stories is a good way to get used to Japanese language
 while you enjoy the stories.
The most important thing to study new languages is "continuing long time".
To do that, you should enjoy studying.
If the way to study is so hard, maybe it would be difficult to continue.
