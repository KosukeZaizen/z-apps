## Why reading Japanese Romaji stories are a good way to study Japanese?

Many Japanese learners feel that studying Japanese is much harder than studying English.
One Reason is that Japanese has three types of characters
 even though English only has the alphabet.
Kanji, specifically, is very difficult to remember
 because there are so many Kanji characters in Japanese.

If you are a beginner in studying Japanese, Kanji will annoy you so much.
When you try to read a Japanese book, it includes a lot of Kanji.
You can not read a normal Japanese document without knowing Kanji.

For many Japanese learners,
 remembering Hiragana is the first step to study Japanese.
But if you are completely new to Japanese,
 perhaps you can not read Hiragana.

 reading stories in Japanese Romaji is a good way to get used to the Japanese language.
 While you can also enjoy the stories.
The most important thing to studying a new languages is to "continue for a long time".
To do that, you should enjoy studying.
If the way in which you study is too difficult, then maybe it's hard to continue.
